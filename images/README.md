# Images folder
The images folder is meant to store all your site's images in one place. 
## Copyright
Be sure you have the necessary copyright to reuse and store the images. You can use Google's Creative Commons search to find licensed images. You MUST still reference the source. https://www.google.com/search?q=bath&tbm=isch&hl=EN&tbs=il:cl
## Image size
Resizing images is important. Those images that have a set size to be displayed must be the same resolution specified. So an image that is 800x500 pixels would always be displayed at 800x500. Do NOT use the "width" and "height" img tag parameters to resize the images on the website. Those HTML tag settings are meant to specify the actual image size and prepare the web browser for the image to be inserted there. The only time an image may be sized bigger than is displayed is when the image needs to "stretch" to fill space, which usually are reference as backgrounds from CSS.
